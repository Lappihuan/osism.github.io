# Manager Node

ðŸ’¡ The Manager Node Deploy Guides describes the initial deployment of a Manager Node. It describes everything
up to that point so that the other Deploy Guides can be used afterwards. The necessary preparations of the
initial configuration repository and a seed node are also included in this guide.
